Diabetes Challenge! Machine Learning in Health
The type of dataset and problem is a classic supervised binary classification.
Given a number of elements all with certain characteristics (features), we want to build a machine learning model to identify people affected by type 2 diabetes.
To solve the problem we will have to analyse the data, do any required transformation and normalisation, apply a machine learning algorithm, train a model,
check the performance of the trained model and iterate with other algorithms until we find the most performant for our type of dataset.

# Diabetes Prediction Patient
> The datasets consist of several medical predictor (independent) variables and one target (dependent) variable,Outcome. Independent variables include the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age,and so on.

###     [Demo FrontEnd](https://habiburrahmankhan.github.io/Diabetes-Prediction-Patient/)
---
## Columns
>  Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
>  Glucose : Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test

> BloodPressure : Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)

> SkinThickness : Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)

> Insulin : 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)

> BMI : Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)

> DiabetesPedigreeFunction : It provided some data on diabetes mellitus history in relatives and the genetic relationship of those relatives to the patient.

> Age : Age (years)

> Outcome : Class variable (0 or 1) 268 of 768 are 1, the others are 0

----
### Task 


> To build a machine learning model to accurately predict whether or not the patients in the dataset have diabetes or not?

---

### Model Training :-
We use four different model 

> 1.Logistic Regression

> 2.KNN

> 3.Random Forest Classifier

> 4.Support Vector Machine
